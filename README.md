# GA-Conway-s-Game-of-Life
The project is incomplete. The project implemented the functions of a genetic algorithm: selection, bitwise crossing of parents, generation and comparison of offspring, mutation of bits/genes. 
When commenting on the functions of the genetic algorithm, you can get an implementation of the game Conway's life in C++. 
In the future, it is worth setting the task of implementing the goal of optimizing the genetic algorithm in the game.
